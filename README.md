The modern version of this tool replicates its functionality using the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages. Built with Python, this tool offers a creative method for sharing secret messages. However, the Caesar Cipher's simplicity makes it less secure, with only 25 possible keys making it easy to crack. While unsuitable for high-security environments requiring strong encryption, it provides an engaging and enjoyable way to exchange private messages.
